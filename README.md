##  Features

- **Real Hand Tracking** â€“ Uses [MediaPipe Hands](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe) for accurate hand gesture detection.
- **Pinch-to-Draw** â€“ Pinch your thumb and index finger together to start drawing.
- **Point-to-Navigate** â€“ Extend your index finger to move the drawing cursor.
- **Open Hand to Stop** â€“ Separate your fingers to stop drawing.
- **Brush Customization** â€“ Choose different colors and sizes.
- **Overlay Toggle** â€“ Show/hide hand landmark skeleton for cleaner presentations.
- **Fullscreen Mode** â€“ For distraction-free presenting.
- **Save & Clear** â€“ Save your drawings or reset the canvas instantly.

##  How It Works

1. The camera captures your video feed.
2. **MediaPipe Hands** detects 21 key landmarks on your hand.
3. The app interprets gestures:
   - **Point Mode** â€“ Cursor follows your index finger.
   - **Draw Mode** â€“ Pinching thumb and index triggers the brush.
   - **Stop Mode** â€“ Open hand pauses drawing.
4. Your strokes are drawn on an invisible canvas above the video feed.

##  How MediaPipe Works

**MediaPipe Hands** is a pre-trained machine learning model from Google that can detect and track hands in real time.

###  Process Flow

1. **Camera Feed** â†’ The webcam provides a live video stream.
2. **Palm Detection Model** â†’ Finds where hands are located in each frame.
3. **Hand Landmark Model** â†’ Predicts **21 3D landmarks** (key points) on each hand.
4. **Gesture Recognition (Custom)** â†’ We define rules like:
   - Pinch = Draw
   - Point = Move Cursor
   - Open Hand = Stop Drawing
5. **Canvas Drawing** â†’ Landmarks are mapped to brush strokes using the Canvas API.

```

### Why This Works Well

- **Pre-trained Model** â€“ No need to collect data or train a model from scratch.
- **Runs Locally** â€“ No internet required after loading the library.
- **High Accuracy** â€“ Works in various lighting conditions and angles.
- **Free & Open Source** â€“ Apache 2.0 License.
