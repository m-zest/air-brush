##  How It Works

1. The camera captures your video feed.
2. **MediaPipe Hands** detects 21 key landmarks on your hand.
3. The app interprets gestures:
   - **Point Mode** – Cursor follows your index finger.
   - **Draw Mode** – Pinching thumb and index triggers the brush.
   - **Stop Mode** – Open hand pauses drawing.
4. Your strokes are drawn on an invisible canvas above the video feed.
